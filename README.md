# Matrix: Check sum
Checks if the sum of values in a given row matches the sum of values in the corresponding column.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method that checks that for the given matrix, where number of rows are equal to number of columns whether the sum of each row matches the sum of the corresponding column i.e. sum
of numbers in row 'i' is the same as the sum of numbers in column 'i' for 'i' ranging from '0' to 'row.length-1'. If this is the case, the method return true. Otherwise, it return false.
* For example, consider the input as:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 2 3 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 5 3 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 3 5 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 8 3 6
* In the above example case, the method should return true. (Sum of 0th row and 0th column is 10, sum of 1st row as well as the 1st column is 18 and so on.)
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution.
* If you think of multiple approaches to solve the problem, implement the solution which minimizes space complexity. Explain the other approaches, and your decision in comments above the code.
